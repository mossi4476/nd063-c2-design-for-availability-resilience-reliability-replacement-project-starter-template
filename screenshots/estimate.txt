Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 
- This is typically near-instantaneous, often within 1-2 minutes, due to automatic failover to the standby replica in a different AZ.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 
- This could be within 5-15 minutes. The exact time would depend on how quickly traffic can be redirected to the standby region.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 
- This is typically near-zero, as data is synchronously replicated to the standby replica in the other AZ.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 
- This could range from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the replication strategy between regions.
- Synchronous replication can achieve near-zero data loss, but may impact performance due to latency. 
- Asynchronous replication may result in slight data loss.

**These estimates align with the general understanding of RTO and RPO in a Multi-AZ, multi-region database setup. 
However, the exact values can vary based on specific configurations and the cloud service provider's capabilities.
